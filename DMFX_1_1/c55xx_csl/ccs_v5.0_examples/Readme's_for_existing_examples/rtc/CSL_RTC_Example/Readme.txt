  Test for RTC timer and alarm functionality.
 
  RTC TIMER & ALARM TEST
 
  TEST DESCRIPTION:
 		This test code verifies the functionality of real time clock (RTC).
  RTC module will be configured and started to increment the configured time.
  Time is read from RTC module to verify whether the timer is running or not.
  Date and time read from the RTC is displayed in the CCS "stdout" window.
  Manual inspection is required to verify whether the timer is running
  or not. Time and Date will be displayed in the format HH:MM:SS:mmmm, DD-MM-YY
  respectively. 'm' in the time format represents millisecond component of
  the time. In the current test code time is set to 12:12:12:12 and date is
  set to 16-10-08. Test code will stop running after displaying the time for
  255 iterations. RTC is configured to generate an interrupt for each second.
  Message with interrupt count will be displayed in the CCS "stdout"  window
  to notify the RTC second interrupt.
 		This test also verifies the generation of alarm interrupt. Alarm time
  is set to 12:12:17:512. So there will be an alarm interrupt at 5 secs after
  starting the timer. A message will be displayed in the CCS "stdout" window
  to notify the RTC alarm interrupt
 
  NOTE: THIS TEST HAS BEEN DEVELOPED TO WORK WITH CHIP VERSIONS C5535, C5515
  AND C5517. MAKE SURE THAT PROPER CHIP VERSION MACRO IS DEFINED IN THE FILE
  c55xx_csl\inc\csl_general.h.
 
  TEST PROCEDURE:
   1. Open the CCS and connect the target (C5535/C5515/C5517 EVM)
   2. Open the project "CSL_RTC_Example_Out.pjt" and build it
   3. Load the program on to the target
   4. Set the PLL frequency to 12.288MHz
   5. Run the program and observe the test result
 
  TEST RESULT:
   All the CSL RTC APIs should return success
   RTC time should be displayed in the CCS stdout window for 255 iterations.
   There should be an increment in the time for each value displayed.
   An interrupt should be generated by the RTC for each second, which will
   be displayed on the CCS "stdout" window
   An alarm interrupt should be generated when time reaches 12:12:17:512
   which will be displayed on the CCS "stdout" window
