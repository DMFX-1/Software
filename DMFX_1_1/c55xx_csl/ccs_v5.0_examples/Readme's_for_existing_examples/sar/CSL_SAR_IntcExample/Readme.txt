  Test code to verify the SAR functionality in interrupt mode
  
  SAR INTERRUPT MODE TEST
 
  TEST DESCRIPTION:
 		This test verifies the functionality of CSL SAR(Successive Approximation
  Register) in interrupt mode. SAR module on C5515/C5517 DSP is used to convert the
  voltage generated by the key pad available on the C5515/C5517 EVM to digital
  values. This key pad is having 10 button with each button having a different
  digital value corresponding to the voltage generated when it is pressed.
 
  During the test C5515/C5517 key pad button voltage is read and the converted
  digital value is displayed in the CCS "stdout" window. This digital value
  corresponds to the voltage of the button pressed while running the test.
  SAR module is having six channels to read the data. This test configures
  channel four for reading the button voltage in interrupt mode. CSL INTC
  module should be configured and SAR ISR should registered before starting
  the SAR data conversion. After successful configuration of the SAR, voltage
  conversion is started using the CSL API SAR_startConversion(). Digital value
  of the button voltage is read in the ISR for 40 times and is displayed in
  the CCS "stdout" window. After reading 40 digital values SAR data conversion
  is stopped and CSL SAR module will be closed.
 
  
   Digital values corresponding to the button voltage will vary slightly
   depending on the system clock value. Below are the range of values for
   each button available on the C5515/C5517 EVM key pad.

    No button pushed: 0x3fb - 0x3ff
    SHIFT:    0x230 - 0x238
    STOP:     0x0
    RWD:      0x20f - 0x216
    MENU:     0x367 - 0x374
    DN:       0x2bc - 0x2c6
    SEL/PLAY: 0x1d3 - 0x1d8
    UP:       0x24f - 0x258
    REC:      0xd5  - 0xd8
    FWD:      0x163 - 0x167
    MODE:     0x30b - 0x316

  
 
  NOTE: TEST SHOULD NOT BE RUN BY SINGLE STEPPING AFTER ENABLING THE SAR
  INTERRUPTS. DOING SO WILL LEAD TO IMPROPER HANDLING OF THE INTERRUPTS
  AND TEST FAILURE.
 
  NOTE: THIS TEST HAS BEEN DEVELOPED TO WORK WITH CHIP VERSIONS C5515 AND
  C5517. MAKE SURE THAT PROPER CHIP VERSION MACRO IS DEFINED IN THE FILE
  c55xx_csl\inc\csl_general.h.
 
  TEST PROCEDURE:
   1. Open the CCS and connect the target (C5515/C5517 EVM)
   2. Open the project "CSL_SAR_IntcExample.pjt" and build it
   3. Load the program on to the target
   4. Set the PLL frequency to 12.288MHz
   5. Press any one of the buttons present on C5515/C5517 EVM key pad.
   6. Run the program and observe the test result
 
  TEST RESULT:
    All the CSL APIs should return success
    Digital value corresponding to a button voltage should be within the
    range specified in the test procedure.
