  Example to dynamically set PLL and LDO values
 
  PLL LDO SETTING EXAMPLE
 
  TEST DESCRIPTION:
         This test code verifies the functionality of CSL PLL and LDO module.
  LDO module on the C5535/C5515/C5517 DSP is used to set the DSP_LDO voltage
  levels to either 1.05V or 1.30V. PLL module on the C5535/C5515/C5517 DSP is
  used to generate clock for CPU and peripherals. A 32KHz input clock is
  supplied to the PLL using which different system clock values are generated.
  Different system clock values are generated by configuring the PLL to
  different divider values.
 
  During the test the DSP_LDO voltage will be set to either 1.05V or 1.30V and
  later the PLL module will be configured to the 60MHz clock frequency using
  PLL_config() API. Configured values are read back and verified using
  PLL_getConfig() APIs. All the values should match the configured values
  except the test lock mon value which will reflect on the registers only
  after the PLL is up. Values read from the PLL are displayed on the CCS
  "stdout" window. Manual inspection is required to verify the test success.
 
  C5515 DSP PLL register bit fields are little different than that of C5535
  DSP. Use the 'PLL_Config' values defined 12.288MHz - 120MHz to verify PLL
  configuration.
  C5517 DSP PLL register bit fields are different, too. Use the 'PLL_Config'
  values defined 12.288MHz-200MHz to verify PLL configuration
 
  NOTE: THIS TEST HAS BEEN DEVELOPED TO WORK WITH CHIP VERSIONS C5535, C5515
  AND C5517. MAKE SURE THAT PROPER CHIP VERSION MACRO IS DEFINED IN THE FILE
  c55xx_csl\inc\csl_general.h.
 
  TEST PROCEDURE:
   1. Open the CCS and connect the target (C5535/C5515/C5517 EVM)
   2. Open the project "CSL_PLL_LDO_Setting_Example.pjt" and build it
   3. Load the program on to the target
   4. Run the program and observe the test result
 
  TEST RESULT:
    All the CSL APIs should return success
    Configuration values read from the PLL should match with the actual
    configured values except the test lock mon value, for both the LDO
    voltage levels.
