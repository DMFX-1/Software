RTC EXAMPLE2 - RTC COMPENSATION TEST</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="RTC2x"></a>
TEST DESCRIPTION:</h2>
<p>This example code tests the RTC module operation with positive and negative compensation settings. The RTC module of C5535/C5515/C5517 DSP can compensate for oscillator drift due to temperature by adding or subtracting the value of the compensation registers (in milliseconds) to the 32KHz counter every hour. RTC module can be configured for positive or negative compensation using "rtc oscillator drift compensation register".</p>
<p>When RTC is configured for positive compensation of value 'N', N number of milliseconds are added to the millisecond component of time. This positive drift in time will occur after change in hours component.After each change in hours component, N number of milliseconds are counted and millisecond count starts again from 0.</p>
<p>NOTE: RTC Positive compensation does not work for the compensation values that are multiple of 10 on the chip C5535. RTC_setCompensation API will return error for such compensation values. This issue is not present on chip C5515.</p>
<p>When RTC is configured for negative compensation of value 'N', N number of milliseconds are removed from the millisecond component of time. This negative drift in time will happen after change in hours component. After each change in hours component count of milliseconds starts from N instead of 0.</p>
<p>This test code configures the RTC for positive compensation and then for negative compensation. Positive compensation setting is also verified with compensation value which is multiple of ten. After starting the RTC, time is read and displayed in the CCS "stdout" window at regular intervals of time. Manual inspection is required to observe the drift in RTC time after change in hours component. Time and Date will be displayed in the format HH:MM:SS:mmmm, DD-MM-YY respectively. 'm' in the time format represents millisecond component of the time.</p>
<p>For each compensation setting this test code will start at time 12:59:59:xxxx and runs till 13:00:01:xxxx. Drift in time will occur after hours component changes to 13 from 12.</p>
<pre class="fragment">Small test log of RTC time when configured for positive compensation of
value 256 is given below. After a change in hours component, milliseconds
are counted till 256 and count again starts from 0. msec count shown below
is not exactly 256 and 0 due to delay in read operation.

<h2><a class="anchor" id="RTC2y"></a>
TEST PROCEDURE:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Open the CCS and connect the target (C5535/C5515/C5517 EVM) </li>
<li>Open the project "CSL_RTC_Compensation_Example_Out.pjt" and build it </li>
<li>Load the program on to the target </li>
<li>Set the PLL frequency to 12.288MHz </li>
<li>Run the program and observe the test result </li>
<li>Repeat the test at the following PLL frequencies C5515: 60MHz and 100MHz C5517: 60MHz, 100MHz, 150MHz and 200MHz C5535 eZdsp: 60MHz and 100MHz </li>
<li>Repeat the test in Release mode</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="RTC2z"></a>
TEST RESULT:</h2>
<ul>
<li>All the CSL RTC APIs should return success </li>
<li>A Positive drift in time(msec) should be observed after change in hours component of time during the positive compensation test </li>
<li>A Negative drift in time(msec) should be observed after change in hours component of time during the negative compensation test </li>
<li>RTC_setCompensation API should return failure when tested with a positive compensation value which is multiple of ten on chip C5515. It should run successfully on chip C5515. </li>
